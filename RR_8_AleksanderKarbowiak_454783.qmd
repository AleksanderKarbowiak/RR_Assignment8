## Ratings of The Office

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
suppressWarnings({
library(readxl)
library(vtable)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
data_office <- read_excel("theOffice_Ratings.xlsx")
})
})
```

Table below presents summary statistics of ***Rotten Tomatoes*** critical responses for every season of ***The Office***. The data was obtained from [*Wikipedia - The Office*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-148)*.*

```{r}
st(data_office)
```

The series had nine seasons. The average rating of the seasons was 7.7/10. The best season was rated 8.4 out of 10, and the worst season was rated 6.3 out of 10. On average, a season of ***The Office*** series got 22 professional reviews.

## Rating over seasons

```{r}
ggplot(data=data_office, aes(x=Season, y=Rating)) +
  geom_line(color="red") +  
  geom_label(label = data_office$Rating, vjust=0.9) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)

```

## Change of ratings season-to-season

```{r}
data_office$RatingChange <- ifelse(data_office$Season==1,0,round(data_office$Rating - shift(data_office$Rating,1,0),2))

ggplot(data=data_office, aes(x=Season, y=RatingChange)) +
  geom_line(color="green") +  
  geom_label(label = data_office$RatingChange, vjust=0.9) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
```

As we can observe, the change of rating was fluctuating more and more over time. Second season was better than first by 0.69 points. We can say that third one was equally good as second. We can see the biggest downgrade between season 7 and 8 - rating of season 8 decreased by 1.51 in comparison to season 7.
